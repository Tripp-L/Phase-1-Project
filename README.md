Casino Games!

This is a page where a user can play free casino games!
As a user, I want to:
See a list of images that represent different casino games. Have easy access to go play that game. Have an easy way to find the game I'm looking for. Be able to comment and rate each game.

Deliverables:

- Make a GET to 'fetch' all casino games.
- Make a 'card' to include description of game and button for url link.
- Make a 'dropdown' button to filter games by first letter of game category.
  -Make a 'submit' button for rating and comments.

"EventListeners":

- 'click' for each image to display description of the game.
- 'click' for URL link to take user to that game.
- 'change' dropdown to filter game categories by first letter.
- 'submit' to add rating and comments.

Stretches:

- Make a 'like button' that will increase likes for each game.
- Make a 'form' to add a new game.
- Make a 'button' that when 'clicked' will go to the next game (or if enough games, button will go to next page of games).
